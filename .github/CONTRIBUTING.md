## Contributor Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

We use a [fork and pull](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow) workflow on GitHub that allows anyone to contribute changes. You don't need any special permissions, just a GitHub account. This is a lot easier to manage if you follow these basic steps:

1. [Fork the Xoops Module repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and work from that
2. Create a [topic branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches) for your changes, and keep all changes on that branch focused on a specific topic.
3. Please consider adding/updating [unit tests](https://phpunit.de/getting-started.html) to include and verify your changes
4. All PHP code is expected to conform to [PSR-12](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12) standards. The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).
5. Once your changes are complete, commit your topic branch to your fork and create a [pull request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
6. Be prepared to discuss your changes. We will review and test each PR, and may need clarification or changes. Once we have completed the review, you changes will be incorporated into XOOPS.


## Pull Requests

- **Document any change in behavior** - Make sure the `/docs/changelog.txt` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before submitting.
